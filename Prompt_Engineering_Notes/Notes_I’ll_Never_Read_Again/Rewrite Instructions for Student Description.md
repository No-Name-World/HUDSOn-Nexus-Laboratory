# Title: Rewrite Instructions for Student Description

# Purpose:
- The purpose of this instruction is to guide how the text should be rewritten.
- It tells the writer to use very simple English.
- It makes sure the writing sounds like a real student.
- It helps keep the explanation clear and easy to understand.
- It also makes sure the meaning and structure stay the same.
- The goal is to produce an assignment-ready description that does not sound professional or AI-written.


```
Please rewrite the text using plain student academic system description style.

STRICT RULES:
- Use very simple English
- Write like a real student explaining their own work
- Use short, direct sentences (one idea per sentence)
- Keep the tone natural and slightly informal, but still academic
- Do not sound like documentation, a report, or AI writing
- Avoid complex vocabulary, advanced grammar, and polished phrasing
- Repetition is allowed if it sounds natural
- Keep the original meaning exactly the same
- Do not add new ideas or remove any information
- Keep the same structure, headings, and paragraph count
- Make it lecturer-ready and assignment-appropriate
- Aim for extremely low AI detection (below 10%)

IMPORTANT:
Do NOT make the writing sound professional, technical, or perfect.
It should sound like a student describing how the system works.
