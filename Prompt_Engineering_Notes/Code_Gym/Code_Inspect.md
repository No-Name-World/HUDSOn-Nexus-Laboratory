Hey ChatGPT, can you help me on this concurrent programming assignment? reply "I'm done" for understanding all requirements

Now I have done my code. I will send the files one by one.
Please reply "yes" only after each file first.

Files I created:
- Main.java
- ATCManager.java
- Airport.java
- FuelTruck.java
- GateManager.java
- Logger.java
- Runway.java
- Plane.java
- PlaneSteps.java

FYI: You will help me check if I missed or did not fulfill any requirement.
