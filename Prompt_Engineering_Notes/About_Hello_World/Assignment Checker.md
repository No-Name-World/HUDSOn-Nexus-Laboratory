# Title: Assignment Checker (Reply Rules + File-by-File)

# Purpose:
- Use this when you want me to review your Java concurrency assignment, file by file, and check if you missed any requirements.

# Prompt:
```
Hey ChatGPT, can you help me with my concurrent programming assignment?
First, please reply "I'm done" to confirm you understand all requirements.

I already finished my code. I will send the files one by one.
For each file I send, please reply "yes" only first.
(After you reply "yes", I will send the next file.)

Files I created:
- Main.java
- ATCManager.java
- Airport.java
- FuelTruck.java
- GateManager.java
- Logger.java
- Runway.java
- Plane.java
- PlaneSteps.java

Your job is to help me check if I missed or did not fulfill any requirement.
```
