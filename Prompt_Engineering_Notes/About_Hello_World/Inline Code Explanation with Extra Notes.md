# Title: Inline Code Explanation with Extra Notes (Beginner Level)


  
# Purpose:
- Use this when you want the code explained inside the code itself
- good for learning with explanations + reasoning



# Prompt:
```
Can you help me add inline comments to this code?

Please write all explanations directly inside the code using inline comments, even if the explanation is long.

Use simple English because I am a beginner.

Explain what each line and process does, step by step.

Also add extra notes to explain what is happening in the program and why it works that way.
